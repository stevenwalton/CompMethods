Description: This is a package for calculation of Levy stable distributions
        (probability density function and cumulative density function) and for
        fitting these distributions to data.
        
        It operates by interpolating values from a table, as direct computation
        of these distributions requires a lengthy numerical integration. This
        interpolation scheme allows fast fitting of Levy stable distributions
        to data using the Maximum Likelihood technique.
        
        Does not support alpha values less than 0.5.
