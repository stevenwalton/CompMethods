Useful Python Functions and Modules
=========================
Directionfield.py is a module created to generate a vector field.  This is analogous to the Directionfiled for MATLAB that was created by Andri Gretarsson

funcollection.py was created as a module for competitive games, as well as predator and prey models.

syspath.py is a useful function that will show the user what paths they can install modules in that will be natively read.  See Lecture 4

snp was a fun little program that demonstrates graphing and simple monte carlo methods with the S&P 500.  Note that Monte Carlo methods are not a great 
way to actually model the stock market.  The levy functions were being used to create better distributions than the normal distribution that was used.  
A levy function is a heavy sided function and will much more accurately model the stock market.  This is beyond the scope of the class though.  It was
just for fun.
