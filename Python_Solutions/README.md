Solutions to First Three Homeworks
===================================
These solutions exist to help those doing the course in Python to catch up with those using it in MATLAB.  You may notice the similarities to MATLAB and
that numpy is basically MATLAB.  We use all the main functions that we use in MATLAB and should catch students up to the what is lectured on in MATLAB.

For More Reading
----------------
Read up on SciPy and NumPy.  I have not noticed a function that was used in the class for MATLAB that was not contained within either of these modules.

Matplotlib - used as a plotting function.  You may notice that it's name is derived from MATLAB.  This is because it has all the same capabilities as that
plotting function, with similar syntax.  There is a lot to this library, much of which we do not go over.

Some other good modules to look into are:

Pandas - data analysis.  This is for if you want to get into more advanced areas, especially with stalk modeling.

PIL - Pillows, Python Imaging Library.  If you wish to do computer vision, then look here.

Pretty Plots - Creates nicer printing.  Especially when working with dictionaries

JSON - A common formatting for web

UrlLib2 - Used to interact with URL's.  We only scratch the surface of this module.  We could do an entire course on this 

Selenium - Generally used for web testing.  It uses a browser to interact with webpages.  This is great if you are testing what users would actually do.

Django - If you're going to create websites with python, use this  (Though Java is a much faster language)
